# Multidimensional Time Series Analysis for Country Similarities
Welcome to the Multidimensional Time Series Analysis for Country Similarities repository! This project is a collaborative effort aimed at exploring similarities between countries based on multidimensional time series data. We've collected economic, health, and sociological data from the World Bank to conduct our analysis.

## Features
* Data Collection: We have gathered economic, health, and sociological data from the World Bank to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
* Data Processing and Visualization: Utilizing powerful Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, we preprocess and visualize the collected data.
* Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering: Employing various techniques for data dimensionality reduction and clustering, including methods like PCA (Principal Component Analysis), t-SNE, and Autoencoder, we aim to uncover non-obvious similarities between countries.

## Used Methods
* Dimensionality Reduction:
  * PCA
  * t-SNE 
  * Autoencoder
* Clustering:
  * K-means
  * K-Means++
  * DBSCAN 
  * Agglomerative Clustering
